Project Overview
================

The Advanced Robotics Navigation Assignment for Research Track I focuses on developing a ROS package to manage a robot's movement within a Gazebo simulation. It involves three main ROS nodes:

- Navigation Node (Node A)
- Target Retrieval Node (Node B)
- Data Processing Node (Node C)

Each node contributes uniquely to the robot's navigation and data processing, enabling efficient movement and target management within the simulation environment.
